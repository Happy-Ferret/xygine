Project Template
----------------

This directory contains a project template for starting new xygine based projects.
Copy this directory somewhere and rename it to your project name, before editing
the top line of the CMakeLists.txt to also include the project name.

Add new source files to the /src directory, and update the CMakeLists.txt file
within the /src directory with the names of new source files.

For an example of this see the Demo directory included in the xygine repository.
