xygine Sprite Editor
--------------------

A simple sprite sheet editor which allows quick definition
of animation ranges in a sprite sheet, and saving to json  
files compatible with xygine's animated drawable component.

The sprite editor is written in .net and requires the .net  
binding of SFML and the newtonsoft json.net library.

The aniation format was originally developed for [CRUSH](https://github.com/fallahn/crush)  
hence the file extension *.cra

See [xygine](https://github.com/fallahn/xygine/wiki) for more details.
