xygineXT
--------

The next iteration of xygine....

![Logo by Baard](xyginext/xygine.png?raw=true)

2D Game Engine Framework built around SFML. xygine implements a scene
graph along with an Entity Component System. I use this as the starting
point for new projects, as it evolves slowly over time. The source for
xygine is released under the zlib license in the hope that it may be
useful for other people - but offers no warranty that it is fit for any
particular purpose, even those for which it was specifically written...

This version provides an overhauled API and, as such, is not compatible 
with existing versions of xygine - hence the slightly different naming.
The biggest changes are to the Entity Component System for flexible, modular
development of systems with a data-driven approach, as well as the
removal of 3D support. If you're interested in a 3D, crossplatform, mobile
compatible framework with a very similar API, check out [crogine](https://github.com/fallahn/crogine).


###### Why xygine?

The name is simply derived from the fact that this is a 2D framework -
hence xy, followed by the gine part of engine (although technically
xygine isn't really an engine).
