xygine
------

![Logo by Baard](xygine/xygine.png?raw=true)

2D Game Engine Framework built around SFML. xygine implements a scene
graph along with an Entity Component System. I use this as the starting
point for new projects, as it evolves slowly over time. The source for
xygine is released under the zlib license in the hope that it may be
useful for other people - but offers no warranty that it is fit for any
particular purpose, even those for which it was specifically written...


Details of xygine features are available on the [xygine wiki](https://github.com/fallahn/xygine/wiki) or for a
practical example of xygine take a look at [Lunar Mooner](https://github.com/fallahn/LunarMooner) or [Pseuthe](https://github.com/fallahn/pseuthe) (which was built
using an earlier version of xygine). The repository also contains an
[example](https://github.com/fallahn/xygine/tree/master/Example) application containing various demos, and 
further examples can be found in the [experimental repository](https://github.com/fallahn/xyExperimental).
The API is [documented with doxygen](https://fallahn.github.io/xyDocs/), which can be generated via the included [doxy](https://github.com/fallahn/xygine/tree/master/xygine/documentation)
file.


###### Why xygine?

The name is simply derived from the fact that this is a 2D framework -
hence xy, followed by the gine part of engine (although technically
xygine isn't really an engine).
